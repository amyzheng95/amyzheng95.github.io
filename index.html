                  <!--I was previously doing a Bachelor of Commerce and majoring in Finance,
                and has already been studying in Bcom for 3 years, however, this summer,
                I transfered faculties to arts and am now doing a <a href="#">Major concentration in
                Computer Science Major</a>.You might be wondering what's the difference of the
                Science computer science major, the answer is: "they are pretty much the same", we
                take the same CS courses it's just the amount of credits needed to complete the programs
                are different!Here's a link to the requirement of the <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/study/2016-2017/faculties/arts/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-arts-ba-major-concentration-computer-science">Art's CS major</a> if you are still curious.-->
